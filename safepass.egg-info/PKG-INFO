# SafePass

**SafePass** is a CLI password manager written in Python, designed for users who value simplicity, security, and full control over their data.

## Key Features

- Strong Encryption: Passwords are protected with PBKDF2-HMAC key derivation for secure, salted, and stretched encryption keys.

- Local Storage: Your credentials are stored in a local encrypted database file, making it easy to back up or transfer without relying on cloud services.

- Secure Password Generation: Automatically generates completely random, high-entropy passwords.

- Lightweight CLI Interface: Manage, view, and generate passwords directly from your terminal with simple commands.
